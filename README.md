## ⚙️ Projects

   - 📚 <strong>Society</strong> - A team project with persons from one Discord community. We have chosen latest technologies in the Frontend and Backend and full picture of one real project.

Design is important part of the project and it is clean and precise, it has modern curves and sections.  Its plan is to give you an idea for a full working product of the social network. The Figma tool allows to inspect every spacing or size of element or image, it is a great way to have a clear view of the screens.

Frontend is based on NextJS Framework, a modern tool that allows creation of application with latest React features. Dynamic Routing is powerful thing that allows to build complex pages with less TypeScript code. Under the hood we use ESLint library that shows if there are problems with written code and to write it in a more cleaner way.
Frontend tools:
Material UI is a must for a React application and allows responsiveness with Grid system, many icons and properties.
For the styling we use rem - this is responsive units and 1rem=16px on different screens and that allows to fit perfectly on different devices and resolutions. Also we have used SCSS it is a next level CSS and is a great syntactically style tool that allows to nest css classes and to have variables and to not repeat the same code.

Backend is a Java monolith Application integrated with Postgres database in Docker container. It is written with Spring Boot latest version. The API documentation is built with Swagger library and provided for the frontend team. With the creation of an account every request is authenticated via Bearer access token. The must for one social network is the chat feature and it is made by WebSocket in Spring Boot App.

Git vesioning of code is followed by rules when the main brach is updated to rebase. 

Every type of task builds us as a team, we have daily meetings and discussions. That builds strong responsibly for the task that we take and helps us to collaborate in a real team. - https://github.com/Society-Project
